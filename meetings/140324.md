# Meeting Agenda

Date: 2014-03-24

Facilitator: Daniel Eineving

Participants: Daniel Eineving, Mikael Malmqvist, Niklas Tegnander, Fredrik Thune

## Objectives
We need to fix the presentation until friday completely. We need a good model
of our application and we need to start coding from our UML.

## Reports
It has shown that the JMonkeyEngine isn't really what we need, so we'll instead
use the libgdx library for the game and the kryonet engine for network traffic.
We've realised that the new MVC approach of ours could be a bad solution,
but we'll try to keep it in some manner. We will instead use the Screen pattern
defined in libgdx.
We've checked out the kryonet and libgdx library and Fredik has written in the 
RAD part 2.
Mikael has created a use case and Niklas and Mikael has created the network protocol
for the applicaiton.

## Discussion items
